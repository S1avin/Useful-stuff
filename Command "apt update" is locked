#This just means that there is an application using apt.

#First try to find out which application it is by using this command in the terminal

ps aux | grep '[a]pt'

#If there is a process running using apt (like apt-get or aptitude), 
#the best thing to do is just to let it finish what its doing. 
#Otherwise you can kill it using

kill <PID of the process>

#After making sure there is no process or killing it, you can just remove the lock using

sudo rm /var/lib/apt/lists/lock
