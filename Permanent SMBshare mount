Add a line for the share, the format would look like this.

//server/share        /mountpoint      cifs   noperm,credentials=/home/user/.file  0  0

File /home/user/.file sould looks like this:
user=username
pass=password

Change the permissions of the file to prevent unwanted access to your credentials:

chmod 600 ~/.file


To check your settings:

sudo mount -a
