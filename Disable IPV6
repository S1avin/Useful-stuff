Disable ipv6 from GRUB
#Ipv6 can also be disabled by editing the grub configuration file

sudo gedit /etc/default/grub

#Look for the line containing "GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX" and edit it as follows

GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX="ipv6.disable=1"

#The same can also be added to the value of the variable named "GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT" and either would work.
#Save the file, close it and regenerate the grub configuration

sudo update-grub2

#Reboot. Now ipv6 should be disabled.
