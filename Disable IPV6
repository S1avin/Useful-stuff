Method 1 - Disable from sysctl

#The first method to disable Ipv6 is to edit kernel level parameters via sysctl interface.
#The kernel parameters that enable ipv6 are as follows:

sysctl net.ipv6.conf.all.disable_ipv6
#net.ipv6.conf.all.disable_ipv6 = 0

sysctl net.ipv6.conf.default.disable_ipv6
#net.ipv6.conf.default.disable_ipv6 = 0

sysctl net.ipv6.conf.lo.disable_ipv6
#net.ipv6.conf.lo.disable_ipv6 = 0

#Note that the variables control "disabling" of ipv6. So setting them to 1 would disable ipv6
#Edit the file - /etc/sysctl.conf

sudo gedit /etc/sysctl.conf

#And fill in the following lines at the end of that file

# IPv6 disabled
net.ipv6.conf.all.disable_ipv6 = 1
net.ipv6.conf.default.disable_ipv6 = 1
net.ipv6.conf.lo.disable_ipv6 = 1

#Save the file and close it. Restart sysctl with

sudo sysctl -p

#Check the output of ifconfig again and there should be no ipv6 address
#If it does not work, then try rebooting the system and check ifconfig again.

Method 2 : Disable ipv6 from GRUB
#Ipv6 can also be disabled by editing the grub configuration file

sudo gedit /etc/default/grub

#Look for the line containing "GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX" and edit it as follows

GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX="ipv6.disable=1"

#The same can also be added to the value of the variable named "GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT" and either would work. Save the file, close it and regenerate the grub configuration

sudo update-grub2

#Reboot. Now ipv6 should be disabled.
